          Originally inspired by the WeeWX version of Brian Underdown's Weather34 website template set. Brian's main website was https://weather34.com/homeweatherstation/index.html. In January, 2019, Brian asked others to take over the distribution/maintenance of his design whilst he concentrated on development of MB NanoSD, called Weather34 MB-SMART. That WeeWX version of the template was, at that time, actively developed by Ian Millard and Jerry Dietrich.</p>
        <p>
          That version was designed explicitly to harness the powerful WeeWX database to generate the weather data charts and statistical data. It was originally built on the current MB-UB40-IHVN which was maintained by Lightmaster (Meteobridge-Weather34-Template). Although we maintained a similar look and feel with MB-UB40-IHVN,the weewx-Weather34 had many unique features. That version was assembled with it's own install package and using its own unique utility, w34_installer.py, to install. This greatly simplified the installation process from that of previous versions.
          As interest in the Meteo-Weather34 port waned, Ian and team shifted over to calling the software Weather34 and started maintaining the repository themselves. The members of the team have shifted over time, with Ian Millard being the Lead/owner of the codebase. The team that maintained Weather34 did everything they could to being it forward to and use the newer technologies that were available but the legacy code was a blocker. So the decision was made to do a rewrite of the codebase. A freeze was placed on Weather34 at version 4.3.1, meaning no further enhancements would be done, only security patches and bug fixes. The Weather 34 codebase was forked and the three main programmers, Iam Millard, Sean Balfour and Steven Sheeley.</p>
